 
This version of HPPD Sim is much cleaner
and compiled with better tools.
Looking back on my old code I realize its a complete mess.
but so was I at the time I wrote it.
How it works:

Press Enter to start the distrubance, tap space to lower
the distrubance level. Tap space faster to lower it further
when you release it will fluxate back to its normal mode.
Also if you use the arrow keys a new image will appear.
Press space to lower the distrubance and it will intergrate
with the  new picture , once you stop pressing space
it will return to normal level. Use the up and down
arrow keys to shift the direction of the fuzz up or down.
Press the "a" key to reduce the distortion, and the "s" key
to increase it. 


That is the basic algorithim, of how the 'visions' I 'see' move in.
I can hold them in as hard as I can by focusing my  mind
but soon as I stop everything blurs and turns back into
energy. Also when looking at different objects or thinking
about different colors it will intergrate the colors or distrubances
into my 'vision'.
